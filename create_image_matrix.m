function [ mosaic ] = create_image_matrix( element_img, matrix_size )
% CREATE_IMAGE_MATRIX generates a simple (double) mosaic image
%
% detailed description: 
%
%	Function takes a building block image (element_img) and a matrix_size 
% 	variable which dictates the height and the width of the output image.
%	Output image is a simple mosaic whose dynamics does not get changed, it's 
%	simply a matrix of smaller building block images.
%
% Input:
%               matrix_size - [H, W] 
%				H - height of the output mosaic image
%				W - width of the output mosaic image
%
%               element_img - 2D, grayscale image
